# COVID-19-Detection-CNN




# COVID 19 was detcted by Chest Xry in intial days. It took time evaluation . So here is the CNN based model which can predict disease  from Chest Xray .
# Samples taken for Normal , Viral , neumonia , Covid.
# create Convolutional Neural Networks, and will be able to train it to classify Chest X-Ray scans with reasonably high accuracy.
